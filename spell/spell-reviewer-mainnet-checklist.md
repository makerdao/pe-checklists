    * [ ] Remove Ilk from Autoline
    * [ ] Set Ilks Debt Ceilings to `0`
    * [ ] Cache Ilks `line` to Reduce in the Global Debt Ceiling
    * [ ] Decrease Global Debt Ceiling by Total Amount of Offboarded Ilks `line` Cached
  * [ ] 2nd Stage Spell Actions
    * [ ] Set Ilk Liquidation Penalty `chop` to `0`
    * [ ] Set Keeper Incentive Flat Rate `tip` to `0`
    * [ ] Check IF `chip` is required to be adjusted as well
    * [ ] Use `DssExecLib.linearInterpolation`
      * [ ] `name` Format matches "XXX-A Offboarding"
      * [ ] `target` matches `spotter`
      * [ ] `ilk` Format matches "XXX-A"
      * [ ] `what` matches `mat`
      * [ ] `startTime` matches `block.timestamp`
      * [ ] `start` matches Var `CURRENT_XXX_A_MAT`
      * [ ] `end` matches Var `TARGET_XXX_A_MAT` (Match Exec Doc & Risk Computations)
        * [ ] Check IF Target `mat` Covers All Remaining Vaults CR times Risk Multiplier Factor
      * [ ] `duration` matches Exec Doc
* [ ] RWA Updates
  * [ ] `doc` (Using the [`_updateDoc` helper](https://github.com/makerdao/spells-goerli/blob/88413f576d14628a3488a096d9da6775bef46eaa/archive/2022-11-14-DssSpell/Goerli-DssSpell.sol#L59) or otherwise)
    * [ ] `init` the `RwaLiquidationOracle` to reset the `doc`
    * [ ] Sanity Check `pip` must be set (not the zero address)

    * [ ] `doc` new legal document (IPFS HASH) matches Exec Doc
    * [ ] `tau` parameter used is the old `tau` value
  * [ ] Debt Ceiling changes (`line`)
    * [ ] Autoline (`line`) + Liquidation Oracle Price Bump (`val`)
      * [ ] Enable Autoline
        * [ ] `ilk` follows format "RWAXXX-A"

    * [ ] Debt Ceiling (`line`) + Liquidation Oracle Price Bump (`val`)
      * [ ] Increase Ilk Debt Ceiling (set DC + increase Global DC)
    * [ ] `bump` `RwaLiquidationOracle` with new computed increased price (`val`)
      * [ ] ensure `val` is set accordingly with autoline max debt ceiling (`line`)
      * [ ] `val` should enable DAI to be drawn over the loan period while taking into account the configured `ink` amount, interest rate and liquidation ratio (see below)
        * [ ] New `val` is calculated with `line * [(1 + duty) ** years] * mat` - rounded up - and makes sense in context of the [rate mechanism](https://github.com/makerdao/developerguides/blob/master/mcd/intro-rate-mechanism/intro-rate-mechanism.md). Minimum duration is usually in the Exec Doc of the spell with the RWAXXX ilk onboarding.
        * [ ] Comment explaining `val` formula (`Debt ceiling * [ (1 + RWA stability fee ) ^ (minimum deal duration in years) ] * liquidation ratio`) is present
        * [ ] Accompanying comment above `bump` line in format `// XXM * 1.XX^X * X.XX as a WAD` corresponding to the `val` calculation formula (e.g. `// 15M * 1.03^2 * 1.00 as a WAD`) is present along with the calculation formula on the line above
        * [ ] IF combining `val` of multiple RWA ilks being combined, `val` calculation is done once per ilk and added to make the total, with workings provided in code comments. The existing `val` value can be retrieved by calling `read()` on `PIP_RWAXX` and converting the result into decimal.
    * [ ] Poke `spotter` to pull in the new price
  * [ ] Soft Liquidation (`tell`)
      * [ ] Call `RwaLiquidationOracle.tell(ilk)`
      * [ ] IF `RWAXX_A_INPUT_CONDUIT` is an instance of [`TinlakeMgr`](https://github.com/centrifuge/tinlake-maker-lib/blob/master/src/mgr.sol) (it is a Centrifuge integration)
        * [ ] Call `TinlakeMgr.tell()` to prevent further `TIN` redemptions in the Centrifuge pool.
* [ ] Payments
  * [ ] MKR transfers
    * [ ] Recipient addresses match Exec Doc
    * [ ] Transfer values match Exec Doc

      * [ ] `restrict` is used for each stream unless otherwise stated in the Exec Doc
      * [ ] `usr` (Vest recipient address) matches Exec Doc
      * [ ] `tot` (Total stream amount) matches Exec Doc
        * [ ] Use `ether` to express decimal (non-integer) values of `tot`
        * [ ] Where vest amount is expressed in 'per year' or similar in the Exec Doc, account for leap days
      * [ ] `bgn` (Vest start timestamp) matches Exec Doc
      * [ ] `tau` (Vest total duration) matches Exec Doc
        * [ ] `tau` is expressed as '`bgn` - `fin`' (i.e. `MONTH_DD_YYYY - MONTH_DD_YYYY`)
        * [ ] `fin` (Vest end timestamp) matches Exec Doc
      * [ ] `eta` (Vest cliff duration) matches Exec Doc
        * [ ] If the Exec Doc does not specify a cliff date (`clf`), `eta` is 0
        * [ ] `clf` (Cliff end timestamp) matches Exec Doc
        * [ ] If `clf <= bgn`, `eta` is 0
        * [ ] If `clf > bgn`
          * [ ] `eta` is expressed as '`clf` - `bgn`' (i.e. `MONTH_DD_YYYY - MONTH_DD_YYYY`)
      * [ ] `mgr` (Vest manager address) matches Exec Doc
        * [ ] If the Exec Doc does not specify a manager address, `mgr` is `address(0)`
    * [ ] Max vesting rate (`cap`) check (MKR, DAI)
      * [ ] The maximum vesting rate (`tot` divided by `tau`) `<=` the maximum vest streaming rate (`cap`)
      * [ ] The maximum vesting rate (`tot` divided by `tau`) `>`  the maximum vest streaming rate (`cap`)
        * [ ] Calculate new `cap` value equal to 10% greater than the new maximum vesting rate
        * [ ] Round new `cap` up with 2 significant figure precision (i.e. 2446 becomes 2500)
        * [ ] Notify Governance Facilitators for addition in Exec Doc AND Exec Sheet
        * [ ] Ensure that `cap` change is noted in the Exec Doc
        * [ ] New `cap` value matches Exec Doc
    * [ ] MKR Streams ([DssVestTransferrable](https://github.com/makerdao/dss-vest/blob/master/src/DssVest.sol#L463))
      * [ ] Increase vest contract's MKR allowance by the cumulative `tot` (total of new MKR vest amounts)
      * [ ] Ensure allowance increase follows archive patterns
  * [ ] Terminate Existing MKR/DAI Streams (`Yank`)
    * [ ] Yanked stream ID matches Exec Doc
    * [ ] Use `MCD_VEST_MKR_TREASURY` for MKR `yank`
    * [ ] Use `MCD_VEST_DAI` for DAI `yank`
  * [ ] Ensure Recipient Addresses match `addresses_wallets.sol`
* [ ] SubDAO Content
  * [ ] SubDAO SubProxy spell execution
    * [ ] SubDAO spell address matches Exec Doc
    * [ ] IF SubDAO spell deployer is a smart contract (e.g. multisig or factory)
      * [ ] Ensure the deployer address is in `addresses_deployers.sol` as an entry
    * [ ] Executed using `ProxyLike(SUBDAO_PROXY).exec(SUBDAO_SPELL, abi.encodeWithSignature("execute()"));`
    * [ ] Execution is NOT delegate call
    * [ ] Reviewer Note: Gas cost may be very high as SubDAO spells execute within the main `cast` execution. (Also note that low level call gas estimation is not done by our scripts)
  * [ ] Maker Core (main spell) SubDAO actions (i.e. operate in Pause Proxy `DelegateCall` context)
    * [ ] No SubDAO contract being interacted with is authed on a core contract like vat, etc. (Check comprehensively where the risk is high)
    * [ ] SubDAO contract licensing and optimizations generally do not matter (except where they pose a security risk)
    * [ ] SubDAO contracts and all libraries / dependencies are verified (Blocking if not true)
    * [ ] Upgradable SubDAO contracts
      * [ ] Any upgradable contracts have the `PAUSE_PROXY` as their `admin` (i.e. the party that can upgrade)
        * [ ] Any upgradable SubDAO contracts with an `admin` that is not `PAUSE_PROXY` are not authed on any core contracts (Blocking)
    * [ ] All SubDAO content addresses (i.e. provided contract addresses or EOAs) present in the Maker Core spell are present in the Exec Doc and are correct. SubDAO addresses being authed or given any permissions MUST be in the Exec Doc. SubDAO addresses being called must be confirmed by the SubDAO spell team.
      * [ ] IF addresses not PR'ed in by the SubDAO team (use git blame for example), SubDAO content addresses all have inline comment for provenance or source being OKed by SubDAO
    * [ ] SubDAO actions match Exec Doc (only where inline with main spell code) and do not affect core contracts
    * [ ] Core contract knock-on actions (such as offboarding or setting DC to 0) are present in the exec and match the code
    * [ ] External calls for SubDAO content are NOT delegate call
    * [ ] Code does not have untoward behavior within the scope of Maker Core Contracts (e.g. up to the SubDAO proxy)
* [ ] External Contracts Calls (Not SubDAOs, e.g. Starknet)
  * [ ]  Target Contract don't block spell execution
  * [ ]  External call is NOT delegate call
  * [ ]  Target Contract doesn't have permissions on the Vat
  * [ ]  Target Contract doesn't do anything untoward (e.g. interacting with unsafe contracts)
  * [ ]  Contracts deployed via `CREATE2` (e.g. if it looks like a vanity address) do not have `selfdestruct` in their code
  * [ ]  MCD Pause Proxy doesn't give any approvals
  * [ ]  All possible actions of the Target Contract are documented
  * [ ]  Target contract is not upgradable
  * [ ]  Target Contract is included in the ChainLog
  * [ ]  Test Coverage is comprehensive
* [ ] ChainLog
  * [ ] Increment ChainLog version based on update type
    * [ ] Major -> New Vat (++.0.0)
    * [ ] Minor -> Core Module (DSS) Update (e.g. Flapper) (0.++.0)
    * [ ] Patch -> Collateral addition or addition/modification (0.0.++)
* [ ] `addresses_mainnet.sol` matches spell code
* [ ] Ensure every spell variable is declared as `public`/`internal`
* [ ] Ensure `immutable` visibility is only used when fetching addresses from the `ChainLog` via `DssExecLib.getChangelogAddress` and `constant` is used instead for static addresses
  * [ ] Fetch addresses as type `address` and wrap with `Like` suffix interfaces inline (when making calls) unless archive patterns permit otherwise (Such as `MKR`)
  * [ ] Use the [DssExecLib Core Address Helpers](https://github.com/makerdao/dss-exec-lib/blob/master/src/DssExecLib.sol#L166) where possible (e.g. `DssExecLib.vat()`)
  * [ ] Where addresses are fetched from the `ChainLog`, the variable name must match the value of the ChainLog key for that address (e.g. `MCD_VAT` rather than `vat`), except where the archive pattern differs from this pattern (e.g. MKR)
* [ ] Spell actions match the corresponding Exec Doc
* [ ] Tests
  * [ ] Ensure each spell action has sufficient test coverage
    _List actions for which coverage was checked here_
  * [ ] Ensure every test function is declared as public if enabled or private if disabled
  * [ ] Ensure that the `DssExecLib.address` file is not being modified by the spell PR
  * [ ] Check all CI tests are passing as at the latest commit
    _Insert most recent commit hash where CI was passing_
  * [ ] Check all tests are passing locally using `make test`
    * [ ] Ensure that only `ETH_RPC_URL` is being used from env (i.e. no `match`, `block` or similar are active in your env)

```
_Insert your passing local tests here_

## Deployed Stage

* [ ] Deployed Spell is Verified
  * [ ] Optimization Enabled: No
  * [ ] Other Settings: default evmVersion, GNU AGPLv3 license
* [ ] Deployed Spell Code matches GitHub
  * [ ] diffcheck etherscan source against spell PR (via `make diff-deployed-spell`)
* [ ] Deployed Spell Etherscan Checks
  * [ ] automated checks via `make check-deployed-spell`
    * [ ] verified
    * [ ] license type matches
    * [ ] solc version matches
    * [ ] optimizations are disabled
    * [ ] dss-exec-lib library address used (under 'Libraries Used') matches the hardcoded local `DssExecLib.address` file
      * [ ] Check again that the PR did not modify the `DssExecLib.address` file (e.g. look under the 'Files Changed' PR tab, etc.)
    * [ ] `deployed_spell_created` matches deployment timestamp
    * [ ] `deployed_spell_block` matches deployment block number
  * [ ] manual checks
      * [ ] Ensure `make deploy-info tx=<tx>` matches [config](https://github.com/makerdao/spells-mainnet/blob/master/src/test/config.sol)
        * [ ] `deployed_spell_created` timestamp
        * [ ] `deployed_spell_block` block number
      * [ ] Ensure Etherscan `Libraries Used` matches DssExecLib [Latest Release](https://github.com/makerdao/dss-exec-lib/releases/latest)
       * [ ] (For your tests to be accurate) git submodule hash matches [dss-exec-lib](https://github.com/makerdao/dss-exec-lib/releases/latest) latest release's tag commit and inspect diffs if doesn't match to ensure expected behaviour (Currently Non-Critical pending the next DssExecLib release, double check that the ExecLib used by the contract matches the latest release)
* [ ] Archive matches `src`
  * [ ] `make diff-archive-spell` for current date or or `date="YYYY-MM-DD" make diff-archive-spell` (date as per target Exec Doc date)
  * [ ] Ensure date corresponds to target Exec Doc date
* [ ] Tests
  * [ ] Ensure that the `DssExecLib.address` file is not being modified by the spell PR
  * [ ] Check all CI tests are passing as at the latest commit
    _Insert most recent commit hash where CI was passing_
  * [ ] Check all tests are passing locally using `make test`
    * [ ] Ensure that only `ETH_RPC_URL` is being used from env (i.e. no `match`, `block` or similar are active in your env)

```
_Insert your passing local tests here_
```

## Handover and Merge Stage

* [ ] Check that the spell address posted by the crafter in [`new-spells`](https://discord.com/channels/893112320329396265/897483518316265553) is correct
  * [ ] Confirm the address in [`new-spells`](https://discord.com/channels/893112320329396265/897483518316265553) (via a thumbs up message reaction, )
* [ ] Ensure that no commits or changes have occurred since the spell was deployed and archived
* [ ] Approve spell PR for merge via 'Approve' review option
