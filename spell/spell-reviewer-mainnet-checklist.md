* IF content related to a Prime Agent is present
  * IF Prime Agent spell is provided
    * [ ] Handover message matches `XXX spell YYYY-MM-DD deployed to 0x… with hash 0x…, direct execution: yes / no` template
    * [ ] IF `direct execution` is `no`
      * [ ] The Prime Agent spell is plotted using `StarGuardLike(XXX_STARGUARD).plot(XXX_SPELL, XXX_SPELL_HASH)`
      * [ ] `XXX` in `XXX_STARGUARD` matches the name of the Prime Agent
      * [ ] `XXX_STARGUARD` is fetched from chainlog
      * [ ] The test ensures the `XXX_SPELL` Prime Agent spell is executable via `StarGuardLike(XXX_STARGUARD).exec()` before `XXX_STARGUARD.maxDelay`
      * [ ] IF plotted but not yet executed spell is still present in the `XXX_STARGUARD`, Governance Facilitators are aware or already notified
    * [ ] IF `direct execution` is `yes`
      * [ ] Provided mandatory explanation of why direct execution is required makes sense on the technical level
      * [ ] The hash is checked via `require(XXX_SPELL.codehash == XXX_SPELL_HASH, "XXX_SPELL/wrong-codehash");` inside the Core spell
      * [ ] The Prime Agent spell is executed via `ProxyLike(XXX_PROXY).exec(XXX_SPELL, abi.encodeWithSignature("execute()"));`

      * [ ] `XXX_PROXY` is fetched from chainlog
    * [ ] Prime Agent spell address (`XXX_SPELL`) matches Exec Sheet
    * [ ] Prime Agent spell hash (`XXX_SPELL_HASH`) matches Exec Sheet
* IF external contracts calls are present (Not Prime Agents, e.g. Starknet)

  * [ ] Ensure the Agreement address is fetched from the `SAFE_HARBOR_AGREEMENT` Chainlog entry
  * [ ] Ensure the helper follows the established archive pattern, executing calls in order and reverting on any failed call
* IF spell interacts with ChainLog
  * [ ] ChainLog version is incremented based on update type
    * Major -> New Vat (++.0.0)
    * Minor -> Core Module (DSS) Update (e.g. Flapper) (0.++.0)

    _List actions for which coverage was checked here_
    * IF SafeHarbor registry updates are present
      * Scope updates use generator coverage, payload review, and post-cast reconciliation instead of a separate Solidity traversal test; other Agreement changes still require appropriate tests

## Pre-Deployment Stage

* [ ] Wait till the Exec Doc is merged
* Exec Doc checks
  * [ ] Exec Doc for the specified date is found in the [`sky-ecosystem/executive-votes` GitHub repo](https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/executive-votes)
  * [ ] Exec Doc is located in the directory matching the target spell date year (`YYYY/`)
  * [ ] Exec Doc file name follows the format `executive-vote-YYYY-MM-DD-optional-description.md`
  * [ ] Extract _permanent_ URL to the raw markdown file and paste it below
    _Insert your Raw Exec Doc URL here_
  * [ ] Ensure the URL uses commit hash that introduced last change to the Exec Doc, NOT merge commit 
    * [ ] IF there is no local copy of [`sky-ecosystem/executive-votes` GitHub repo](https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/executive-votes), run:
      ```
      git clone https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/executive-votes
      ```
    * [ ] OTHERWISE, ensure it is pointing to the latest commit on main:
      ```
      git switch main && git pull origin main
      ```
    * [ ] Get the latest commit hash for the exec doc:
      ```
      git log --pretty=oneline -1 -- "<LOCAL_PATH_TO_EXEC_DOC>"
      ```
  * [ ] Using Exec Doc URL from the above and the `TARGET_DATE`, generate Exec Doc Hash via `make exec-hash date=$TARGET_DATE $URL`
    _Insert your Exec Doc Hash here_
  * [ ] Using Exec Doc URL from the above, generate Exec Doc Hash via `cast keccak -- "$(curl '$URL' -o - 2>/dev/null)"`
    _Insert your Exec Doc Hash here_
  * [ ] Make sure that hash above doesn't match `keccak` hash of the empty string (`0xc5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470`)
  * [ ] Using Exec Doc URL from the above, read spell instructions from the Exec Doc and list them below
    _List all instructions announced in the Exec Doc_
  * [ ] Office hours value in the Exec Doc matches the spell
  * [ ] Sum of all payments in the Exec Doc matches the tests
  * [ ] Exec Doc URL in the spell comment matches your Raw Exec Doc URL above
  * [ ] Exec Doc URL in the spell comment refers to the [https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/executive-votes](https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/executive-votes) repository
  * [ ] Every action present in the spell code is present in the Exec Doc
  * [ ] Every action in the Exec Doc is present in the spell code
* IF new commits are present in the spell
  * [ ] Copy relevant checklist items from the above and redo them
  * [ ] Ensure newly added code is covered by tests
  * [ ] Check if chainlog needs to be updated
  * [ ] Copy over and redo "Tests" section from the above
* [ ] IF all checks pass, make sure to include explicit "Good to deploy" comment

## Deployed Stage

* Crafter's comment in the PR
  * [ ] Contains relevant Foundry installation logs
  * [ ] Contains a URL to the deployed spell
    * [ ] URL matches the spell address declared in `config.sol`
  * [ ] Contains a URL to the Tenderly Testnet
* Source code settings
  * [ ] Deployed spell is verified on etherscan
  * [ ] Optimization enabled: `false` UNLESS the contract size is too big AND all mitigation strategies (i.e.: removing revert strings) have failed
  * [ ] Default evmVersion
  * [ ] GNU AGPLv3 license
* Source code validity
  * [ ] Deployed spell code matches source on github. (can be checked via `make diff-deployed-spell` or manually)
  * [ ] No new changes are made after previously given "good to deploy"
* Deployed spell Etherscan checks
  * [ ] Ensure local code is up-to-date with the remote branch (e.g. `git pull`)
  * Automated checks via `make check-deployed-spell`
    * [ ] Verified
    * [ ] Valid license
    * [ ] Version matches
    * [ ] Optimizations are disabled
    * [ ] dss-exec-lib library address used (under 'Libraries Used') matches the hardcoded local `DssExecLib` address inside `foundry.toml`
    * [ ] `deployed_spell_created` matches deployment timestamp
    * [ ] `deployed_spell_block` matches deployment block number
  * Manual checks
    * [ ] Ensure `make deploy-info tx=<tx>` matches [config](https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/spells-mainnet/blob/master/src/test/config.sol)
      * [ ] `deployed_spell_created` timestamp
      * [ ] `deployed_spell_block` block number
    * [ ] Check again that the PR did not modify the `DssExecLib` address inside `foundry.toml`
    * [ ] Ensure Etherscan `Libraries Used` matches DssExecLib [Latest Release](https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/dss-exec-lib/releases/latest)
    * [ ] (For your tests to be accurate) git submodule hash matches [dss-exec-lib](https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/dss-exec-lib/releases/latest) latest release's tag commit and inspect diffs if doesn't match to ensure expected behaviour (Currently Non-Critical pending the next DssExecLib release, double check that the ExecLib used by the contract matches the latest release)
* Tenderly Testnet checks
  * [ ] A testnet with the name matching spell description is found at [maker dashboard](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/maker/virtual-networks)
  * [ ] The testnet name is unique (previous testnets does not have the same name)
  * [ ] Cast transaction is set to the correct "receiver" (matches deployed spell address)
  * [ ] All actions are executed in the transaction trace
  * [ ] No reverts are present that block execution
  * [ ] No out-of-gas errors are present
  * [ ] Set `ETH_RPC_URL` to the RPC URL of the Tenderly Testnet where the exact deployed spell was cast
  * [ ] Confirm the Sheet still matches the approved source reviewed above; repeat source and payload review if it changed
  * [ ] Independently run `make safeharbor-verify` after the cast, even if the spell contains no SafeHarbor updates; require success with no updates and no validation warnings
  * [ ] Record the successful verification output with the review evidence
  * IF verification fails
    * [ ] Use `make safeharbor-inspect` to investigate, resolve the failure with Governance Facilitators, and rerun verification before handover
    * Successful inspection or an empty changes list is not proof of a match; warnings can block change calculation
* Archive checks
  * [ ] `make diff-archive-spell` for current date or `make diff-archive-spell date="YYYY-MM-DD"`
  * [ ] Ensure date corresponds to target Exec Doc date
* Tests
  * [ ] Ensure that the `DssExecLib` address inside `foundry.toml` is not being modified by the spell PR
  * [ ] Check all CI tests are passing as at the latest commit
    _Insert most recent commit hash where CI was passing_
  * [ ] Ensure that any other env variable does not affect execution of the tests (for example, by inspecting the output of `printenv | grep "FOUNDRY_\|DAPP_"`)
  * [ ] Check all tests are passing locally using `make test`
* [ ] Publish an explicit "good to handover" comment

```
_Insert your local test logs here_
```

## Handover and Merge Stage

* [ ] Check that the spell address posted by the crafter in the [Sky Core Executive Vote Address Handover Thread](https://forum.skyeco.com/t/sky-core-executive-vote-address-handover-thread/27995) is correct
* [ ] Confirm the address in the thread – via the forum "Reply" button on the post containing the current spell address, restating the address to make later edits detectable
  * Example: ``Confirming {YYYY-MM-DD} Core Spell at [`{SPELL_ADDRESS}`]({BLOCK_EXPLORER_URL}).``
  * [ ] Wait until both spell reviewers confirm the spell address in the Handover Thread
  * [ ] Wait until Responsible Governance Facilitator confirms handover in the Handover Thread
* [ ] Ensure that no changes were made to the code since the spell was deployed and archived
* [ ] Approve spell PR for merge via 'Approve' review option
