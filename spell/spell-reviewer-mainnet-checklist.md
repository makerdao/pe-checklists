    * [ ] IF multiple RWA ilks are being combined into one, `val` calculation is done once per ilk and added to make the total, with separate executable formulas provided in comments. The existing `val` value can be retrieved by calling `read()` on `PIP_RWAXX` and converting the result into decimal
    * [ ] Oracle price is updated via `DssExecLib.updateCollateralPrice(ilk)`
    * IF soft liquidation explicitly requested to be triggered (via `.tell(ilk)`) AND debt ceiling is `0` (OR is being set to `0` in the current spell)

      * IF `eta` is explicitly specified in the Exec Sheet, then the values match
      * IF `eta` and `clf` (Cliff end timestamp) are not specified in the Exec Sheet, then `eta` is `0`
      * IF `clf` is specified, but `clf <= bgn`, then `eta` is `0`
      * IF `clf` is specified and `clf > bgn`, `eta` is expressed as `clf - bgn` (i.e. `MONTH_DD_YYYY - MONTH_DD_YYYY`)
    * [ ] IF `mgr` (Vest manager address) is specified in the Exec Sheet, matches the value, OTHERWISE matches `address(0)`
    * [ ] Ensure that max vesting rate (`cap`) is enough for the new streams
      * The maximum vesting rate (`tot` divided by `tau`) `<=` the maximum vest streaming rate (`cap`)
      * The maximum vesting rate (`tot` divided by `tau`) `>`  the maximum vest streaming rate (`cap`)
      * Calculate new `cap` value equal to 10% greater than the new maximum vesting rate, then round new `cap` up with 2 significant figure precision (i.e. 2446 becomes 2500)
    * IF max vesting rate (`cap`) is changed in the spell
      * [ ] Governance facilitators were notified
      * [ ] Exec Sheet contain explicit instruction
      * [ ] Exec Sheet contain explicit instruction
    * IF MKR stream ([DssVestTransferrable](https://github.com/makerdao/dss-vest/blob/master/src/DssVest.sol#L463)) is present
      * [ ] Vest contract's MKR allowance increased by the cumulative `total` (the sum of all `tot` values)
      * [ ] Ensure allowance increase follows archive patterns
    * [ ] Tested via `testVestDAI` or `testVestMKR`
  * IF `MKR` or `DAI` vest termination (`Yank`) is present
    * [ ] Yanked stream ID matches Exec Sheet
    * [ ] `MCD_VEST_MKR_TREASURY` chainlog address is used for MKR stream `yank`
    * [ ] `MCD_VEST_DAI` chainlog address is used for DAI stream `yank`
    * [ ] Tested via `testYankDAI` or `testYankMKR`
* IF SubDAO-related content is present
  * IF SubDAO provides SubProxy spell address
    * [ ] SubDAO spell address matches Exec Sheet
    * [ ] Executed via `ProxyLike(SUBDAO_PROXY).exec(SUBDAO_SPELL, abi.encodeWithSignature("execute()"));`
    * [ ] Execution is NOT delegate call
    * [ ] IF SubDAO spell deployer is a smart contract (e.g. multisig or factory), ensure the deployer address is in `addresses_deployers.sol` as an entry
    * [ ] Ensure that SubDAO spell have enough gas and does not revert with "out of gas" error inside simulation. Note: low level call gas estimation is not done by our scripts
  * IF SubDAO provides instructions to be executed by the main spell (i.e. that will operate within Pause Proxy `DelegateCall` context)
    * [ ] No SubDAO contract being interacted with is authed on a core contract like `vat`, etc. (Check comprehensively where the risk is high)
    * [ ] SubDAO contract licensing and optimizations generally do not matter (except where they pose a security risk)
    * [ ] SubDAO contracts and all libraries / dependencies have verified source code (Blocking)
    * Upgradable SubDAO contracts
      * [ ] Upgradable contracts have the `PAUSE_PROXY` as their `admin` (i.e. the party that can upgrade)
      * [ ] Any upgradable SubDAO contracts with an `admin` that is not `PAUSE_PROXY` are not authed on any core contracts (Blocking)
    * [ ] All SubDAO content addresses (i.e. provided contract addresses or EOAs) present in the Maker Core spell are present in the Exec Sheet and are correct. SubDAO addresses being authed or given any permissions MUST be in the Exec Sheet. SubDAO addresses being called must be confirmed by the SubDAO spell team.
    * [ ] IF addresses not PR'ed in by the SubDAO team (use git blame for example), SubDAO content addresses all have inline comment for provenance or source being OKed by SubDAO
    * [ ] SubDAO actions match Exec Sheet (only where inline with main spell code) and do not affect core contracts
    * [ ] Core contract knock-on actions (such as offboarding or setting DC to 0) are present in the exec and match the code
    * [ ] External calls for SubDAO content are NOT delegate call
    * [ ] Code does not have untoward behavior within the scope of Maker Core Contracts (e.g. up to the SubDAO proxy)
* IF external contracts calls are present (Not SubDAOs, e.g. Starknet)
  * [ ] Target Contract doesn't block spell execution
  * [ ] External call is NOT `delegatecall`
  * [ ] Target Contract doesn't have permissions on the Vat
  * [ ] Target Contract doesn't do anything untoward (e.g. interacting with unsafe contracts)
  * [ ] Contracts deployed via `CREATE2` (e.g. if it looks like a vanity address) do not have `selfdestruct` in their code
  * [ ] MCD Pause Proxy doesn't give any approvals
  * [ ] All possible actions of the Target Contract are documented
  * [ ] Target contract is not upgradable
  * [ ] Target Contract is included in the ChainLog
  * [ ] Test Coverage is comprehensive
* IF spell interacts with ChainLog
  * [ ] ChainLog version is incremented based on update type
    * Major -> New Vat (++.0.0)
    * Minor -> Core Module (DSS) Update (e.g. Flapper) (0.++.0)
    * Patch -> Collateral addition or addition/modification (0.0.++)
  * [ ] New addresses are added to the `addresses_mainnet.sol`
  * [ ] Changes are tested via `testNewOrUpdatedChainlogValues`
* [ ] Ensure every spell variable is declared as `public`/`internal`
* [ ] Ensure `immutable` visibility is only used when fetching addresses from the `ChainLog` via `DssExecLib.getChangelogAddress(key)` and `constant` is used instead for static addresses
  * [ ] Fetch addresses as type `address` and wrap with `Like` suffix interfaces inline (when making calls), UNLESS archive patterns permit otherwise (Such as `MKR`)
  * [ ] Use the [DssExecLib Core Address Helpers](https://github.com/makerdao/dss-exec-lib/blob/master/src/DssExecLib.sol#L166) where possible (e.g. `DssExecLib.vat()`)
  * [ ] Where addresses are fetched from the `ChainLog`, the variable name must match the value of the ChainLog key for that address (e.g. `MCD_VAT` rather than `vat`), except where the archive pattern differs from this pattern (e.g. MKR)
* Tests
  * [ ] Ensure that the `DssExecLib.address` file is not being modified by the spell PR
  * [ ] Check all CI tests are passing as at the latest commit
    _Insert most recent commit hash where CI was passing_
  * [ ] Ensure every test function is declared as `public`
    * [ ] IF the test needs to run, it MUST NOT have the `skipped` modifier; OTHERWISE, it MUST have the `skipped` modifier
  * [ ] Ensure each spell action has sufficient test coverage
    _List actions for which coverage was checked here_
  * [ ] Ensure that any other env variable does not affect execution of the tests (for example, by inspecting the output of `printenv | grep "FOUNDRY_\|DAPP_"`)
  * [ ] Check all tests are passing locally using `make test`
    * [ ] Ensure every test listed in the _coverage_ item above is present in the logs and with the `[PASS]` prefix.

  * [ ] Extract _permanent_ URL to the raw markdown file and paste it below
    _Insert your Raw Exec Doc URL here_
  * [ ] Using Exec Doc URL from the above and the `TARGET_DATE`, generate Exec Doc Hash via `make exec-hash date=$TARGET_DATE $URL`
    _Insert your Exec Doc Hash here_
  * [ ] Using Exec Doc URL from the above, generate Exec Doc Hash via `cast keccak -- "$(curl '$URL' -o - 2>/dev/null)"`

* [ ] Confirm the address in the [`new-spells`](https://discord.com/channels/893112320329396265/897483518316265553) channel (via a separate "reply to" message, restating the address to avoid edits)
  * [ ] Wait until responsible governance facilitator confirms handover in `new-spells`
* [ ] Ensure that no changes were made to the code since the spell was deployed and archived
* [ ] Approve spell PR for merge via 'Approve' review option
