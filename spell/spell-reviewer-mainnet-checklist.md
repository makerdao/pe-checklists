# Mainnet Executive Spell Review Checklist

Repo: https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/spells-mainnet

## Development Stage

* Prepare the `spells-mainnet` checkout
  * [ ] Checkout the spell PR from a trusted local copy of the [`sky-ecosystem/spells-mainnet` repository](https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/spells-mainnet)
    ```bash
    gh pr checkout PR_NUMBER
    ```
* Confirm that Foundry setup changes are handled separately
  * IF the spell PR changes `Makefile` or any repository-controlled file loaded or executed by a Foundry setup target, including files under `scripts/setup-foundry/`
    * [ ] Ask the spell team to move the Foundry setup changes to a separate maintenance PR
    * [ ] Resume only after the maintenance PR is merged and the spell PR is updated
* Verify and install the Foundry toolkit
  * Failure handling — applies throughout Phases 1–3
    * IF any Foundry setup command below exits nonzero, apply this recovery branch immediately
      * [ ] Stop Foundry setup
      * [ ] Record the failed command and complete output in the spell PR
      * [ ] Diagnose and resolve the failure
      * [ ] IF verification fails after a successful mandatory installation, diagnose the verifier failure, including `PATH`
      * [ ] Rerun the exact failed command
        ```text
        _Insert the complete command output here_
        ```
      * [ ] IF the failure cannot be resolved, notify the spell team
  * Phase 1 — Mandatory release acceptance
    * [ ] Run `make select-foundry`
      ```text
      _Insert the complete selector output here_
      ```
    * [ ] Treat the selected release as the release under review
    * IF there are any published Foundry [security advisories](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/security/advisories) for the release under review
      * For each advisory
        * [ ] Compare its affected version range with the release under review
        * [ ] IF the release is affected or applicability is unclear, review every linked official upstream source
        * [ ] Record the evidence below
          ```text
          Foundry advisory: _Insert URL_
          Affects release under review: Yes / No / Unclear — _Insert rationale_
          Linked official sources: None / _Insert URLs and outcome_
          ```
    * [ ] Copy the workflow-level Foundry settings from the checked-out spell PR's `.github/workflows/tests.yaml` into the block below
      ```text
      FOUNDRY_RELEASE: vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
      FOUNDRY_IGNORE_AGE: 0 / 1
      ```
    * [ ] IF the spell PR changes `FOUNDRY_RELEASE`, read the release under review's complete [release notes](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/releases) and confirm that no breaking change prevents spell building, testing, or deployment
      ```text
      Release notes: _Insert exact release URL_
      Compatibility: Compatible / Incompatible — _Insert rationale_
      ```
    * IF the release under review does not pass the security review or applicable compatibility check
      * [ ] Stop Foundry setup
      * [ ] Notify the spell team that the release under review failed the security review or applicable compatibility check
      * Repeat until the release under review passes the security review and any required compatibility check
        * [ ] Select an exact alternative supported by an official upstream reference
        * [ ] Treat the alternative as the release under review
        * [ ] Repeat the security and applicable compatibility checks above
      * [ ] Review the crafter's alternative-release comment and confirm that it identifies the passing alternative reviewed above, cites its supporting official upstream reference, and requests a cooling-period waiver IF AND ONLY IF the alternative is less than 14 days old
      * [ ] IF the comment does not match the passing alternative, upstream reference, or applicable cooling-period waiver requirement, stop approval and notify the spell team
      * IF the comment matches
        * [ ] IF the alternative is less than 14 days old, reply using `Approved alternative Foundry release: vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH; cooling-period waiver: approved.`
        * [ ] OTHERWISE, reply using `Approved alternative Foundry release: vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH; cooling-period waiver: not required.`
      * [ ] Confirm that the other spell reviewer replied with equivalent approval naming the same release and waiver outcome
    * [ ] Record the passing selected release or passing explicitly approved alternative as the required release
      ```text
      Required release: vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
      ```
  * Phase 2 — Independent CI synchronization review
    * [ ] Confirm that `FOUNDRY_RELEASE` matches the required release
    * [ ] IF a cooling-period waiver was approved, confirm that `FOUNDRY_IGNORE_AGE` is `"1"`
    * [ ] OTHERWISE, confirm that `FOUNDRY_IGNORE_AGE` is `"0"`
    * [ ] Confirm that the `Install Foundry` step in `.github/workflows/tests.yaml` runs `make install-foundry release="${FOUNDRY_RELEASE}" ignore-age="${FOUNDRY_IGNORE_AGE}"`
    * [ ] Confirm that the `Verify Foundry` step in `.github/workflows/tests.yaml` runs `make verify-foundry release="${FOUNDRY_RELEASE}" ignore-age="${FOUNDRY_IGNORE_AGE}"`
  * Phase 3 — Mandatory developer installation and verification
    * [ ] Run `make install-foundry release=vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`; IF the required release is less than 14 days old and its cooling-period waiver was approved, include `ignore-age=1`
      ```text
      _Insert the complete installer output here_
      ```
    * [ ] IF the installer reports `Required action: update-path`, apply the printed `PATH` instructions
    * [ ] Run `make verify-foundry release=vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`; IF the required release is less than 14 days old and its cooling-period waiver was approved, include `ignore-age=1`
      ```text
      _Insert the complete verifier output here_
      ```
    * [ ] Confirm that the final verifier exits `0` and reports the required release as both desired and installed
